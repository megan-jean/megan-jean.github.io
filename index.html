    <h1>Hi there.</h1>
    <p>
      I’m an Austin-based, multi-disciplinary Product Designer who focuses on
      design research, interface aesthetics, and user-centered design
      interactions. I am currently attending school for UI/UX Design at the
      University of Texas, Austin, McCombs School of Business. I am of the firm
      belief that the definition of great user experience is a design that goes
      completely unnoticed by the user. Great design is seamless, never hinders
      a user, and should be easily facilitated by people of all backgrounds and
      abilities in our new digital world. When I'm not working, you can most
      likely catch me reading, drawing, enjoying a local dive, cooking with the
      freshest ingredients I can find, or traveling around South East Asia. I'm
      currently reading About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design by Alan
      Cooper, and thoroughly enjoying reruns of the undisputed classic, Planet
      Earth.
